**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Spotify Dataset:-**


**1. Introduction**

Spotify, one of the leading music streaming platforms, provides extensive data on songs, artists, and user interactions. This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Spotify dataset to uncover insights into music trends, song popularity, and key audio features that define successful tracks.


**2. Dataset Overview**

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing various attributes related to Spotify songs. Some of the key columns include:

Track Name & Artist: Identifies the song and its performer.

Danceability: Measures how suitable a track is for dancing.

Energy: Represents the intensity and activity of a song.

Loudness: The overall loudness level in decibels.

Speechiness: The presence of spoken words in the track.

Instrumentalness: Indicates if the track is mostly instrumental.

Valence: The positivity of a songâ€™s musical elements.

Tempo: The speed of the track measured in beats per minute (BPM).

Duration: The length of the song in milliseconds.

3. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

To ensure high-quality analysis, the dataset underwent multiple preprocessing steps:

Missing Values Handling: Checked and addressed any null values.

Feature Engineering: Removed unnecessary columns such as 'Unnamed: 0'.

Data Type Conversion: Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types.

Duplicate Removal: Ensured data integrity by eliminating duplicate records.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly. Some key analyses include:

Distribution of Audio Features: Visualized danceability, energy, and valence to understand common song characteristics.

Top Artists & Songs: Identified the most popular artists and their frequently occurring tracks.

Correlation Analysis: Examined relationships between features like tempo, loudness, and energy.

Genre & Popularity Trends: Investigated how different genres perform based on their audio features.

Duration & Tempo Insights: Analyzed if shorter songs or specific tempo ranges correlate with popularity.

5. Insights & Key Findings

High-energy and danceable songs tend to be more popular.

Most popular tracks fall within a moderate tempo range (100-130 BPM).

Instrumental tracks are less frequent among top-performing songs.

Loudness and energy exhibit a strong positive correlation.

Some artists appear frequently in top tracks, indicating consistency in popularity.

6. Conclusion & Future Scope


**Conclusion:-**

This project provides a deep understanding of key attributes influencing song success on Spotify. The findings can be beneficial for artists, producers, and marketing teams to optimize track characteristics for better engagement.
